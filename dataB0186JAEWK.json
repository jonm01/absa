            "review_text": "Easy to set up. Easy to use. Photos are sharp. You must first download the app (to set up). Once you do, you can just say \"Alexa, take a photo\" and it will take the photo (with flash). You will get a notification on your phone and you can see the photo immediately. At that point, you can delete it, or take another. Once you take your photo, you have the option to make some small edits (saturation, etc). However, you cannot crop your photo. *AMAZON - THIS IS MY BIGGEST GRIPE: I want to be able to crop my photo and take my clutter out!* (I cropped my crap out of the photo I provided - to show quality). You can also take two photos and get an opinion as to which is better, as well as suggestions for similar looks. Options to make notes on the outfit\u200b. The front page of the app also has (of course) links to shop clothing, as well as relevant articles (ex: sponsored by Vogue). You can delete individual photos. I also use this to take progress photos for fitness, and I delete those REAL QUICK - they don't get uploaded to Amazon Heaven. Once you take the photo, you have the option to delete or share (several apps, including google drive). I have no idea where they really go, because I don't see them in my phone gallery *AMAZON GENIE - MY SECOND WISH: that I can save to my phone & full transparency on where these things actually 'go' This device also can take video. And play music though doesn't have the (annoying) bass of the large echo. I have another Echo elsewhere in the home. One can play different music on each device without any additional membership (I have prime only, not prime music). How does it compare to mirror selfies: (1) you don't need a mirror, you can see yourself in the phone). (2) Somehow I look better (pre edit) in photos taken by the Look than in my phone photos - they're very saturated and sharp with the device. (3) you can take the photo without the risk of selfie stick shadow, and without the annoying flash of your camera (and phone itself) in the photo. I paid for this device, but was able to order it early. I also have 1984 paranoia, so I turn it to face the wall when I'm not using it.",

It will just save you the trouble of making he return. If amazon listens to the consumer maybe they will improve the app and it will get better. Right now I will have to return everything because it just doesn't work properly yet. So sad too. I was so looking forward to organizing all my clothing and shoes into different collections. But this would take me years to do since the app crashes nonstop. And apparently this was happening to everyone. I didn't read the reviews prior to purchasing. Shame on you amazon! it's not like you don't have the resources to make a decent product.",

            "review_text": "I'll update this once I've used it more, but so far I enjoy it. When I first set it up I had it so it took photos looking in the direction of my bed because that was the only option. It was horrible. I hated all my photos, I hated my body, I was like whelp no this isn't happening. So, she went back in the box. Cue about four days later, I opened it up and tried it again by pointing it in the direction of my white closet doors. It made SUCH a huge difference. My photos come out a lot crisper. One thing I would definitely note is that if you're tall, you're going to have to work with it a little to find the right angle. I'm 6'1 and when they said to put it at shoulder height they were SO wrong. It made me look dumpy. Try a different angle if you absolutely hate it at first. I can't comment on long-term usability yet but another suggestion, if you do not have a plain backdrop, is to hang up a sheet per a suggestion from a friend. That works super well too. Overall, I'm satisfied. Would I pay $200 for it? Absolutely not. Would I wait for Prime Day or Black Friday or whatever comes up next that drops it to $100? Yes. Totally not worth paying full price for it, because at the end of the day, it's a glorified Alexa with a freakishly good camera. I can do the same thing with a closet app on my phone and take mirror selfies. I'd say that's one difference with the Alexa though, you can see your backside, which can be helpful when you're comparing prints or shapes of skirts. The one time I used the \"compare outfits\" option already knowing which one looked styled better, she got it right, so I'm happy with that.",

            "review_text": "The Echo Look is an Artificial Intelligence device, AI, that can help you do many things in your life. It has almost all of the current features that are available in the Amazon Echo but it also has a 5 MP digital camera that you can control using your voice. Rather than holding your smart phone for taking selfies, you can ask the Echo Look to take a full length photo of yourself and take photos from many angles while you pose. You can capture and store the photos of all of your outfits in the Amazon Cloud so you can compare them and have the Echo Look tell you which outfit looks the best on you using style check. Style check is an AI software that uses input from fashion specialist to judge how your different outfits compare to today\u2019s most popular styles. You can also use the photos to send to your favorite social network and have a full length photos rather than just a close up selfie. The camera can take high quality photos and videos. The camera has its own built in lighting and a depth sensing camera. The photos add in a digital blurring called Brokeh effect. It means that the subject of the photo, you, stands out and the background is blurred as not to distract from your crystal clear photo. This shallow depth of field makes a perfect portrait photo of professional quality. You are the \u201cstar model\u201d while using this camera and you can take as many poses as you wish using the Echo Look. We found the photos to be of good quality and the blurring of the background works very well. I have not posted any photos or videos with this review as Amazon has done a good job supporting this product with their own videos. You should take the time to watch them. My attached video goes over the product and what I liked and I didn\u2019t like. We already use three Amazon Echoes in our home, one on each floor, and we like the features that Alexa can do for us. The Echo Look can do these same features that we use daily: \u2022 Set daily alarms like get up times or time to take your medicine, or pick up your child at school. \u2022 Set one time occurring alarms like time to leave for movies. \u2022 Set timers for deadlines like cooking alerts or to get the clothes out of the dryer. \u2022 Find a local restaurant. \u2022 Get the time of the day or the date. \u2022 Check the scores of the NFL games. \u2022 Check the weekly game schedule of your favorite team. \u2022 Play your favorite music style, my wife likes 70\u2019s rock. \u2022 Find your local weather or ask if it will rain today. \u2022 Turn lights off and on in your home. \u2022 Control various items in your home like sprinklers, appliances, lights, etc\u2026 \u2022 Tell you the latest news. \u2022 Read your Kindle books to you and she does quite well doing this. Not only can she play your audio books but she can also read your digital Kindle books using text to speech technology. This is one of my favorite features when my eyes get tired from reading. \u2022 Check the traffic. \u2022 Check your calendar. \u2022 Look up recipes for food or mixed drinks. \u2022 Tell you a joke. \u2022 Help to do your Amazon shopping. \u2022 The opportunities are endless\u2026. Amazon Echo Look can do all of this and more. It is a virtual digital personal assistant. You can also view the photos using the Echo View app that is available for your Apple IOS 9 or higher or Android phone or tablet using Lollipop or above operating systems. Alexa responds to voice commands to take photos or 6 seconds of a video. Alexia will continue to learn things as you use her. She will even continuously learn from the fashion specialist to help you select the best outfits to wear. The Look has a 1.6 watt speaker and a microphone array to listen to your verbal commands. There is a microphone array and camera off button so you can be assured of your privacy. Four LEDs are used to provide lighting for photos and they are bright. The camera is 5 MP with depth-sensing technology. The unit has an Intel Atom CPU. Please see my attached video. Your photos and videos are stored in the cloud and Amazon provides 3 years of free unlimited cloud storage. The Echo Look also has a 1 year warranty. What\u2019s in the box? \u2022 The Echo Look which is smaller than I expected. It is about 5 \u00bc inches tall. It weighs in at 5.4 ounces. It has two camera thread bosses in the unit and one is on the bottom and the other is located on the back. That allows for easy wall mounting or simply standing the unit up on a shelf. You can adjust the tilt angle using the mounting base. On the side is a microphone and camera off and on button. In the back is a speaker output and the plug for the power input. On the top is the four microphone array. On the front is the camera and the 4 lighting LEDS. For great photos, make sure the camera lens is free of dust and smudges. \u2022 Mounting base that has a tilt-able camera thread stud. It also has a rubber ring to prevent slipping. \u2022 Power adapter rated at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hertz the output is 15VDC at 1.4 Amps and it is UL listed. The power cable is almost 8 feet long from the AC wall plug to the tip of the power plug for the Amazon Echo Look. \u2022 Mounting wall kit consisting of the wall plate, 2 screws and 2 anchors \u2022 Quick start guide \u2022 It is important to note that the base of the Echo Look has a standard camera sized tripod socket. Normally you set the Look close to the edges of a table or counter so as your photo does not include the table top in the photo. You need to stand about 5 feet away and center yourself and say, \u201cAlexa take a photo.\u201d You can just as easily take a short 6 second video. You want the lens about shoulder height. You can tilt the Look as needed but make sure that it is stable to prevent it from falling. When setting up the unit it wants to connect to the same WIFI as the smart device that you are using the Echo Look app on. First install the downloadable apps onto. Your smart phone or tablet, plug in the Amazon Look device and turn on the app. All you have to do is follow the instructions. Since you are using the same WIFI as your smart device the Look already knows the WIFI password because of that. That makes it simple, fast and easy to set up. To have the Echo Look read one of your Kindle books you will have to use the Amazon Alexa App and you will find that the Echo Look device is listed as an acceptable device for setup in that app. Just follow the steps to read your Kindle book just like you would using your Amazon Echo. If you have any questions just post a comment. Cons: 1. No manual volume control, only voice controlled. 2. The unit has a small speaker and the audio quality is OK for its size but it is not great nor is it nearly as good as the standard Amazon Echo speaker system. 3. I like the small size and it is nice to set in the edge of a shelf or chest of drawers. By having such a small size the volume level and the timber of the audio is not as good as the original Echo. 4. The unit has a single button to disable the camera and the microphone. There should have been two buttons. If you press the button, the microphone is turned off and now you cannot use Alexa for any of the features like play music that need a voice command. Having two buttons would have allowed you to turn off the camera but leave the microphone on. 5. If you press the button to turn off the mic and the camera, a red light comes on dimly around the camera and a small bright red LED comes on to indicate that the camera and the mic mute button are off. Having two LEDS on the front is not good in my opinion. If you turn the Echo Look camera/mic off then you will see these two lights in your dark bedroom at night. I find these LED lights to bother me when I\u2019m trying to go to sleep as they light up the room in some manner. Since we normally dress in our bedroom this would be the most common place for us to located the Echo Look. Overall this is a nice product and the next generation of Amazon intelligent devices. It is part of the move to higher technology and I rated it at 4 stars. I think it will be a hit for the younger generation that are trying to be stylish every day in the way they dress for school, work or just for a night out. Anyone that works in a professional office would also find the camera useful to help them select the right outfits to wear to work. If you have any question please write me a comment. I also hope the attached video was helpful in some way to help you make a decision on the product.",

            "review_text": "Dear Amazon, We like your stuff and we love technology. We have over a half dozen devices, and two prime accounts going in our family of 5. Multiple Echos, a Tap, and the husband unit even has one of those Echos with the screen. As a designer & maker, and someone who does not purchase a lot of RTW, the Echo Look could be useful. I like technology to help humans be better. The Echo Look really could help with more responsible consumption and fewer bad fast-fashion purchases (which means fewer returns.) Also, for those of us really involved in #mmmay - there are quite a few people out there who have a hard time keeping up the whole month, and this could be the answer. Hopefully this is fixed by 2019 for #mmmay19 Ok. That was the good part and to counter the really lame trolls on here. Be part of the solution. Seriously. I\u2019ve had the Echo Look for 2 weeks now. Went into the store 4 days ago, hoping an employee could answer questions. Employees had never even seen one, and pointed me to the phone number for customer service. Today I called customer service. First I talked to TK, who tried to tell me that Amazon wasn\u2019t available at this time (um, I\u2019m in the same time-zone). That was funny, and not in a good way. TK told me that they only trouble shoot problems and that they can\u2019t forward my call to the design team (which I did not ask for, I asked for someone on his team that knew about app/device updates and about using the Echo Look.) TK forwarded me to \u201cGeorge\u201d - I will note that George started out with an American Southern accent which he quickly lost as he went back to his native language accent. I\u201dm not sure what the point of that was....? I think after he realized I wasn\u2019t Grandma complaining about not being able to get ther Fire stick to work, he dropped the fake southern accent. George actually tried to first talk me into returning the device. You might want to look into that. George didn\u2019t know anything either, and eventually told me to write a review here. The Catch-22 is amazing. The store knows nothing and points consumers to the phone people. The phone people are irritable, they do not like that I\u2019m asking device & app update questions, they don\u2019t know anything, and point consumers to return the product or write a review here. Ok, now to my problems and requests for solutions. 1. Pre, what, 2000, I was that person that got red-eye when not even looking at the camera. Technology and cameras have advanced so that isn\u2019t an issue...or I pull out the DSLR and use an external flash - but even then, my DSLR is new enough it doesn\u2019t really have those issues. The Echo Look\u2019s 4 LEDs are SO bright, I look like a Replicant from Blade Runner. No exaggeration. It\u2019s like you went back in time with technology. Not even looking at the camera, I still get retina refraction like crazy. I tried putting scotch tape over the LEDs to soften the impact which reduces the Replicant look by 50% but then the app doesn\u2019t like that and tells me something is wrong and till not apply any of the filters or the blurry vignette feature (Pop.) You have to fix this. I\u2019m NOT alone. Going through Instagram for EchoLook photos is like Replicant Tinder. You\u2019ve got to do a hardware OS update and fix that, and/or allow the app to reduce flash brightness. 2. Let\u2019s talk about Pop or the weird blurry vignette slider that isn\u2019t really a slider. Yes, it is helpful, but please update app so that slider is really a slider. Right now it is A. Nothing. B. You\u2019re floating in a blurry cloud C. You\u2019re actually swimming in amniotic fluid. 3. The fashion compare options. HAHAHA. Oh. Please. The algorithm is set to 1950. Seriously, try it. Put on, say, nice linen overalls with a wide leg, paired with a mid-volume silk shirt - totally on trend, and put it next to an outfit that looks like it was bought from Chicos (think princess seamed button up shirt in novelty print, and a defined waist-pant, and it picks the Chicos outfit every time. Fit & Flare isn\u2019t the only design aesthetic, thanks. Please update app to have style preferences. Think Stitch Fix or the Nordstrom version of Stitch Fix...it\u2019s for men, so my husband uses it, not me, but they\u2019re VERY good. You\u2019re in the same town as Blake, just go over and ask him how they set up the Nordstrom version of Stitch Fix, \u2018kay?? 4. You may need a more diverse group working on this product. I\u2019ll let you figure out that one, but I\u2019ll give you a hint. If you gear something towards women, with ONLY women in ALL of the product demos, then maybe there should be more women, particularly women in fashion/design, involved in the process. Also...you may want to diversify your product demos... lovely range of women with POCs...all the same size and age range. And just women. Call me, I\u2019ll help you. 5. I shouldn\u2019t have to pull this all into PhotoShop. This should be plug-in-play directly to Instagram. You\u2019re losing SO much with all of these issues. Your Echo Look account isn\u2019t even used - I\u2019ve got a stinking suspicion you\u2019re already planning on dropping this product. I can\u2019t find ANY reviews other than the PR release you GAVE out. I seriously don\u2019t care what 40+ year old hetero white men not in fashion/design have to say about this product, nor what they forced their single female staffer to do with it. There\u2019s NOTHING. Which tells me there\u2019s suppression, and possibly such a great loss already you\u2019re looking to bag out completely and are ready to erase it. I\u2019d prefer you supported it instead. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea. I prefer it to having to set up my DSLR or propping my iPhone on my tripod...but my iPhone takes way better photos and has a portrait option that rivals my DSLR. That and no replicant. /novella",

I didn\u2019t use to pay attention to what I wear and ended up repeating the same clothes over and over that looked tired and boring. Got this device on a whim just to try out how it works. After 3-4 days of taking my pictures with the device I realized I was repeating the same colors, wearing similar clothes. Its different from looking yourself in the mirror everyday because your brain forgets (and ignores). But the Echo Look phone app captures your looks over days and shows you trends, which is a real eye-opener. I decided to clean up my closet, it motivated me to go donate so many old clothes that were tired now and didn\u2019t even look good on me. I pulled out clothes I had bought but were hidden somewhere in the closet, experimented with a few combinations and realized I actually have some good clothes that I wasn\u2019t wearing! Just looking at yourself from a third person perspective helped me discover what looks good on me. I imagine looking back at my pictures several years from now and seeing how I\u2019ve aged and changed my looks over time. Some people say that I can just take a selfie or use my phone. I thought so too, but no that doesn\u2019t work for two reasons 1) selfies don\u2019t capture a full-length view and who\u2019s gonna plug the phone in and out of a selfie stick every morning, no way! 2) the convenice of just asking Alexa to take a picture is unbeatable. It reduces the friction in the process which is needed if you want to be consistent and capture your looks regularly so you can review and find patterns. Thank you Amazon for being so innovative! When I first heard of the device I thought its a joke, but I now realize how cool and useful it is!",

I now live alone and in a different time zone. Here comes the Echo Look. I am not saying that it replaced my sisters' opinions but it is doing a banging job trying to be on their level. At time I am unsure about an outfit and the Echo Look has been helpful in coming up with the best/most perfect choice. The Echo Look has the function of all the other Echo device, however it does not sound as good. I would not recommend playing music with it, the music sounds as if it is coming off of one of those old disc (the one before cassette tapes). It does answers to other questions just as the other echo, I just do not personally the sound system in the Echo Look when it comes to answers to those command. Since it was not designed for that purpose, I can say that the bad sound system does not bother me much and will not deduct any stars. It got even better when Amazon fix the commands so that when I ask regular questions, my other echos answer instead of the Echo look. Final Thoughts: I highly recommend this if you're not good at pairing your outfits, if you own too many outfits and need a way to keep track, and/or just for the heck of it. It is not an expensive selfie camera as some have asked, it does a really great job at being a great personal stylist. I highly recommend this product.",

I wish there were a way to save the photos to Prime photos or Yahoo etc as I haven't been able to get them to my PC to back up or use. I wasn't familiar with designer names so wasn't chosen for any focus groups when the email was sent, but have since found I have a lot of those designer clothes in my closet from shopping at Marshall's and Ross. At 67, I'm not really the target market for this item, but have enjoyed the pictures as weight continues to drop. The speaker on this is really poor, and as it's set up in my living room, it often hears when I try to play music on my kitchen Echo and plays instead of the main Echo, so now I keep the microphone on the Echo Look turned off except for taking photos. I wish it had at least two choices as to the focal distance. I wear a lot of wigs and would like to take my wig-review photos with Look, as well as photos of makeup and nails, but the camera is strictly for full-body shots. The main purpose of this item appears to be selling expensive high-end clothing, and it now sends advertisements for such in the app. It could be useful for so much more than it currently is with just a second distance setting and a way to share photos to Prime etc.",

The camera quality is terrible, the speaker quality is terrible, you cannot use it for calling or messaging, and if you connected in via the app to use the video camera, the quality is on par with a 56k faxmodem. Abysmal product when compared to Amazon's other offerings.

Most of the time it doesn\u2019t acknowledge any other question or command other than \u201ctake a picture.\u201d I\u2019ve really thought about returning it because it\u2019s so expensive, but I\u2019m holding out hope that there\u2019s an update that might fix my frustrations. I would advise waiting to purchase until the device improves.",

I can now look at something I would normally be drawn to & think \"Nope, you know this will be in a Goodwill bag in a year\" Just recently found a dress I was In Love with. Checked off all the boxes. Got home, Alexa took a picture. and oh no. The cute little dancing flowers in my mid section turned me from fairy to forest creature. The Look really is priceless. I admit it hurts to see it on Prime Day for half of what I paid but if you truly want to be your best self, You need an honest look. Thanks to the Look, you can now honestly see yourself in pictures, video & comparison outfits, Plus a Digital library of closet when you need inspiration or a shopping reminder to walk away from the floral top. Btw, the Look speaker for music is horrible. Sounds like an old AM radio. Look does give you full interactive Alexa like news, jokes, and of course shopping but limits features like no phone If you want music though, Tap is The choice. It is the only portable device. Even the Dot is wired. As much as I've learned from my Look from fashion choices to spotting a couple extra lbs, my favorite feature is the one that creates memories by taking full length pix of special occasions. I can share the pic to my photo editor, prime photo or text to friends. A selfie is nice but it's not the whole Look.",

            "review_text": "I grew up with two sisters and when we dress up we always double check with each other to ensure that we chose the right belt color, the right top to match and even the best matching shoes. I now live alone and in a different time zone. Here comes the Echo Look. I am not saying that it replaced my sisters' opinions but it is doing a banging job trying to be on their level. At time I am unsure about an outfit and the Echo Look has been helpful in coming up with the best/most perfect choice. The Echo Look has the function of all the other Echo device, however it does not sound as good. I would not recommend playing music with it, the music sounds as if it is coming off of one of those old disc (the one before cassette tapes). It does answers to other questions just as the other echo, I just do not personally the sound system in the Echo Look when it comes to answers to those command. Since it was not designed for that purpose, I can say that the bad sound system does not bother me much and will not deduct any stars. It got even better when Amazon fix the commands so that when I ask regular questions, my other echos answer instead of the Echo look. Final Thoughts: I highly recommend this if you're not good at pairing your outfits, if you own too many outfits and need a way to keep track, and/or just for the heck of it. It is not an expensive selfie camera as some have asked, it does a really great job at being a great personal stylist. I highly recommend this product.",
